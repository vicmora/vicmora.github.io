I am passionate about everything data: analytics, visualization, dashboards, business intelligence, podcasts, books, subreddits, stackoverflow, and blogs. I currently spend most of my time in Python, JavaScript, and SQL.

Soccer is another one of my passions. I'm a Club America and FC Barcelona supporter and I also play a couple of times per week.
